## Hand Motion-Controlled Remote Car

### Problem Statement
Recent developments in research of motion-tracking and gesture-controlled robotic
products have shone a new light on entertainment, special needs teaching, and
accessibility-focused applications. Products like motion-sensing console controllers,
robotic arms, and prosthetics have popularized and extended the knowledge on gesture
and impulse-based technologies throughout the past few years, and their market
is predicted to continue to grow in the future.
To provide a better understanding of the concepts associated with the forementioned
technologies through Research and Development (R&D), the project will consist of a
gesture-controlled car with a wristband as a remote controller. The user will be able to
accelerate and steer the vehicle using natural wrist and finger movements.
